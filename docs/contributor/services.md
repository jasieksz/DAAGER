# Core services

There are several core services (located in the **age3-core** module), that are required for AgE 3 to work:
* discovery — performs node discovery,
* identity — provides info about nodes,
* lifecycle — manages the lifecycle of a node,
* topology — manages node topology (it's different from the compute-level topology),
* worker —manages task execution.
